## About
This application was adapted from the Course Maker to provide a way for lazy LaTeX typesetting. To use it, use the buttons or keyboard shortcuts below to add the components you want. When you are done, LaTeX it!
### Keyboard Shortcuts for the website
* Alt-E : Insert inline equation
* Alt-D : Insert display equation
* Alt-T : Insert text box
* Alt-L : Insert line break
* Enter : Generate LaTeX code

Please note that no shortcuts work when you are typing (on the website). To use a shortcut, click anywhere outside the input field first.

All keyboard shortcuts work in the desktop app as well, but using `Commnd` instead of `Option`.
